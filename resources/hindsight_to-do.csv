Priority,Title,Description
1.1,Make Hindsight Manager Terminal Agnostic,"Update the Hindsight Manager script to remove dependencies on specific terminal emulators (e.g., gnome-terminal), allowing it to run in any standard terminal environment."
1.2,Develop Automated Test Suite,"Write a comprehensive suite of automated tests using pytest to validate the core application logic, ensuring stability and quality."
1.3,Implement End-to-End Encryption,"Implement end-to-end encryption for all captured screenshot and text data files at rest to enhance privacy."
1.3,Implement Memory Deletion Feature,"Implement a feature in the Manager app that allows users to securely delete specific memories or entire timeframes from the archive."
1.4,Implement Whitelisting Feature,"Develop and integrate an application/window title whitelisting feature into hindsight.conf to simplify the capture configuration process."
1.5,Implement Python Error Logging with Configurable Levels,"Implement structured error logging within Python files with customizable logging levels (e.g., INFO, WARNING, ERROR) controllable via Hindsight Manager."
1.6,Gemini API Token Usage Tracker,"Develop and deploy a token usage tracker for the Gemini API to monitor costs and usage patterns."
1.7,Implement Export/Import Functionality,"Create a feature to allow users to export their entire memory database and configuration to a portable format, and to import it on another machine."
2.1,Implement Git Tag-Based Release and Update Strategy,"Transition the project to use Git tags for official releases and modify the update script to fetch and check out the latest stable tag instead of pulling from a branch."
2.2,Investigate Cross-Distro Portability,"Investigate the necessary code and dependency modifications to ensure Hindsight can operate effectively on Debian-based systems and other Linux families."
2.3,Centralize API Key Configuration,"Integrate all external secrets, like the content of service-account.json, directly into hindsight.conf to create a single source for all user-defined settings."
2.4,Train Embedding and Re-ranker Model with DistilBERT,"Train the embedding and re-ranker models using DistilBERT to optimize performance for semantic config searches within the Hindsight application."
2.5,AI Behavior Control in Manager,"Develop a feature within the Hindsight Management Script to allow configuration and control of the AI API's behavior."
2.6,Implement Hybrid Configuration Search in TUI,"Integrate the Recoll and FAISS indexes into the Hindsight TUI to enable hybrid searches within the application's configuration files."
2.7,Enhance Hindsight Management Script,"Implement features to show daily index update details, improve scrolling for long command outputs, and address any known bugs in the Hindsight Manager."
2.8,Enhance Multi-Monitor Support,"Improve the screen capture service to intelligently detect and capture only the active window, even across complex multi-monitor setups."
2.9,Create CONTRIBUTING.md File,"Write a contributing.md file that clearly outlines the development workflow, coding standards, and process for submitting pull requests."
2.10,Investigate ChromaDB as FAISS Replacement,"Investigate the feasibility and benefits of replacing the FAISS vector index with ChromaDB for semantic search."
2.11,Implement Resource Monitoring Alerts,"Add a feature to the TUI dashboard that sends a system notification if CPU or disk usage exceeds a user-defined threshold for a sustained period."
3.1,Evaluate Config File Usability,"Refine the interactive installer's Q&A to further simplify the configuration process and add inline help text for complex options."
3.2,Rewrite manager code to differentiate between desktop and CLI launch,"Rewrite the manager code to differentiate between desktop and CLI launch."
3.3,Modify Manager to accept and execute multiple options in sequence,"Modify the manager to accept and execute multiple options in sequence."
3.4,Develop Search History Feature,"Develop a search history feature in the Manager app that logs and integrates both semantic and keyword searches for user review."
3.5,Create GitLab Issue Templates,"Develop and implement templates in the GitLab repository for standardized Bug Reports and Feature Requests."
3.6,Create ROADMAP.md File,"Draft a ROADMAP.md file to detail the long-term vision for Hindsight and list potential new features and milestones for the community."
3.7,Create Basic User Manual/Getting Started Guide,"Develop a user-friendly manual (e.g., in Markdown) providing step-by-step instructions for installation, configuration, and basic usage, aimed at non-technical users."
3.8,Create Simple Website/Landing Page for Hindsight,"Build a simple website or landing page for the Hindsight application using a free platform like Google Sites to improve discoverability and provide project information."
4.1,Add UI Theming Support,"Add basic theming capabilities to the Open WebUI interface and the TUI dashboard to allow for user customization."
4.2,Create Project Badge,"Design and generate a project badge for display on the GitLab README and within the GitLab project interface."
